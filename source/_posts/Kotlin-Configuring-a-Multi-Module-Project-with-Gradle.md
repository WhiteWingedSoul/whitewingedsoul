Hello and happy new year to everyone who happens to check out this blog. 
2018 was a great journey, i've got to :
- meet inspirational people throughout events like VN Tech, VietPro, Rakuten Conference...

- explore Google Japan office !!!
- work on different areas of software development
- move to a quiet place outside Tokyo to save money

- and last but not least, [the first post on this blog](https://thelonedev.com/20181110-how-this-site-was-made/) xD

I hope 2019 will be a phenomenon year as well, for me and for all of you who's reading this blog.
So to begin the journey, i will write a series of posts about Kotlin and all the technology i've been working with recently, starting from this one.
